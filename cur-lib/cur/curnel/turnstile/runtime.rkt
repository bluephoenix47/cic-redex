Cur is implemented by type-checking macro expansion into Racket run-time terms.

TODO: Shouldn't these be curnel-terms, not run-time terms? Maybe not, if we're calling the Surface
language core "Curnel"

The run-time terms are either:
1. A Racket identifier x, as long as the binding x at one phase higher is bound to an identifier-info.
2. A transparent struct inheriting from constant, as described below.
3. The struct (cur-Type i), where i is a natural number
4. The struct (cur-Π t f), where t is a run-time term and f is a run-time term.
5. The struct (cur-λ t f), where t is a run-time term and f is a run-time term.
6. A plain application (#%plain-app cur-apply rator rand) of a run-time term to a run-time term.
7. A plain application (#%plain-app cur-elim target motive method-ls), where elim is the function defined
   below, target is a run-time term, motive is a run-time term, and method-ls is a list of run-time
   terms.

Any module that requires a Racket library, rather than a Cur library, is considered unsafe.
Cur does not guarantee that requiring such modules with succeed, and if it succeeds Cur does not
guarantee that it will run, and if it runs Cur does not guarnatee safety.

; A Cur identifier is any identifier that is bound at phase j to a runtime term and bound at phase j+1
; to an identifier-info.

; An inductive type is a transparent struct that inherits constant, and has

; as a constructor at phase j and is bound to a constant-info as phase j+1.

; A constructor is a transparent struct that inherits constant, and has

; The type of the constant must be an inductive type, possibly applied to dependent indices.

; TODO:
; Currently, inductive types and constants are treated as uninterpreted functions. Eventually, I'd
; like to make them more like records and give the functional nature as a macro. This is backwards
; incompatible and requires care.
; The constant-info-type-constr would be a procedure that takes one argument for every argument to the
; inductive type, and produces a runtime term as a syntax object representing the type of the
; inductive type.
; This requires some alternative type for constant identifier, used when e.g. typing a data declaration
; and adding the identifier to a context. This would be similar to the Πᵤ type I've used in my other work.
