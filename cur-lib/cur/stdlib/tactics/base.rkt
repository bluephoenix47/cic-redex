#| NB:
 | The design of Cur currently seems to prevent intermediate type-checking

 | type-checker or extend it with a notion of holes.
 | TODO: A noation of holes may be useful in general.
 |#

#| NB:
 | Per below, note that Cur already has contexts. The issue with
 | type-checking intermediate results has to do with the fact that Cur

#|
 | A Goal, aka, Theorem is a syntax object representing a Cur proposition (type).
 |
 | A Expr is a syntax object representing Cur expression (term).
 |
 | A Hole is a procedure of type
 |
 | A Proof is (Either Ctxt Expr)
 |
 | A Ctxt is a procedure Proof -> Proof representing a Cur expression
 | with a hole.
 |
 | A Environment is a map from Symbol to Theorems.
 |
 | A Proof-State is a struct containing:
 |   env: An Environment, the assumptions introduced during a tactic
 |        script.
 |   goals: A map from Natural to Goal, the goals necessary to finish
 |          this proof
 |   current-goal: A Natural, the index into goals of the current Goal
 |                 to be proved.
 |   proof: A Proof, representing the proof so far. when the proof is
 |          an Expr, the proof is complete.
 |   theorem: A Theorem, the original statement of the theorem this proof is
 |            attempting to prove.
